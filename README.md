**A benchmark-driven NTFS search engine for Windows.** UFFS reads the Master File Table directly, builds a compact persisted index, and keeps large NTFS estates searchable through a background daemon.

> Proven on a real 7-drive, 25.9M-record Windows system; scale-ceiling tested to **100.4M records** with offline MFT clones:
> - **66 s COLD** — raw MFT read + compact index build
> - **6.9 s WARM CACHE** — restart from serialized cache
> - **163 ms HOT full scan (`*`)** — end-to-end across all 7 live drives
> - **9–13 ms HOT targeted queries** — exact/prefix/ext/substring end-to-end
> - **0–3 ms daemon-side** for targeted queries, even at 100.4M records

UFFS is built for **exact filename, path, and metadata search** at scales where directory walking, shell search, and some automation surfaces become the bottleneck. It is open source, written in Rust, and designed first for deterministic local search; CLI, TUI, API, and MCP are all interfaces on top of the same engine.

> An open-source NTFS search engine for Windows power users, developers, IT teams, and investigations-style workflows.

> **Open source, forever.** The UFFS platform — engine, daemon, CLI, and MCP server — is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE). Code released as part of UFFS Core will never be made less open. Commercial products and enterprise offerings are built on top of the open platform, not by restricting it.

## Why UFFS?

- ⚡ **100M-record proven scale** — measured from 25.9M across 7 drives up to 100.4M across 16 drives
- 🚀 **Cold / warm / hot architecture** — build once from raw MFT, restart fast from cache, answer hot queries from memory
- 🔍 **40+ filters** — size, date, extension, type, attributes, path length, tree size, regex
- 🧩 **One engine, multiple interfaces** — CLI, TUI, daemon, API, and MCP share the same index
- 🧭 **Deterministic local scope** — built for exact NTFS filename/path/metadata search, not fuzzy ranking
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform offline analysis** — live NTFS on Windows; offline MFT analysis on macOS and Linux

## Benchmark snapshot (v0.5.21)

Measured on AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, 64 GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro 24H2, 7 NTFS volumes totaling 25.9M records; scaled to 100.4M with offline MFT clones.

| Phase | What happens | ALL 7 drives | Single NVMe |
|-------|--------------|-------------:|------------:|
| **COLD** | Raw MFT read, parse, compact index build, cache write | 66 s | 7.7 s |
| **WARM CACHE** | Daemon restart + serialized cache load | 6.9 s | 6.4 s |
| **HOT** | Query a running daemon with the index already in memory | **163 ms e2e** (`*`) | **27 ms e2e** |

Hot-path context (30 rounds, p50):
- **0–1 ms daemon-side** for targeted queries (exact, prefix, ext, substring, combined)
- **9–13 ms** end-to-end for targeted queries across all drives
- **407×** cold→hot speedup across all 7 drives
- **323k rows/sec** bulk export throughput (CSV, `--out-dir`)
- **100.4M records** tested: targeted queries still **11–13 ms e2e**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build from source (requires Rust nightly — see rust-toolchain.toml)
cargo build --release

# Search all drives (daemon starts automatically)
uffs "*.rs"

# Search a specific drive
uffs "*.txt" --drive C

# Filter by size, date, type
uffs "*.log" --min-size 100MB --newer 7d --files-only

# macOS/Linux: search offline MFT captures
uffs "*.txt" --data-dir ~/uffs_data

# Daemon management
uffs daemon status
uffs daemon restart
```

## How It Works

1. **Read** — Opens the raw NTFS volume and reads the MFT sequentially using IOCP with a sliding window. Bitmap skip eliminates 40–55% of I/O by skipping deleted records.
2. **Parse** — Each I/O buffer is parsed inline into a compact 224-byte `FileRecord` — zero intermediate copies, zero per-record heap allocations. On NVMe, Rayon parallelizes parsing across all CPU cores.
3. **Index** — Records are stored in a compact in-memory index with extension and trigram accelerators for fast targeted queries. DataFrame/export paths are built on top of the same core engine.
4. **Serve** — A background daemon holds the index in memory and answers queries via IPC. CLI, TUI, and MCP clients all share the same daemon.

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `uffs-mft` | Direct MFT reading → compact in-memory index ([📖](crates/uffs-mft/README.md)) |
| `uffs-core` | Query engine (Polars lazy API) |
| `uffs-daemon` | Background index server ([📖](docs/user-manual/daemon.md)) |
| `uffs-cli` | Command-line interface ([📖](docs/user-manual/cli-overview.md)) |
| `uffs-mcp` | MCP server for AI agents ([📖](docs/user-manual/mcp.md)) |
| `uffs-polars` | Polars compilation-isolation facade |
| `uffs-client` | IPC client library |

## Alternatives & Landscape

UFFS was built after the author wrote [an earlier C++ MFT search tool](https://github.com/githubrobbi/Ultra-Fast-File-Search) and then rebuilt it from scratch in Rust for safety, performance, and maintainability.

### Comparison scope

UFFS competes first in the **local NTFS filename/path/metadata** lane: exact search across large Windows filesystems with deterministic scope and a reusable in-memory daemon.

We do **not** collapse all search products into one "fastest search tool" claim. The following are different benchmark classes and should be compared separately:

1. **Readiness** — cold build, warm restart, and hot query
2. **Interactive search** — end-to-end top-N query latency
3. **Bulk retrieval** — time to stream or export large result sets
4. **Scale ceiling** — largest corpus completed without timeout, crash, or incorrect results

That distinction matters because a tool can be excellent at interactive top-N search and still hit a wall during full-result export or very large automation workloads.

The older C++ implementation remains useful as a parity and regression baseline, but it is **not** the headline market benchmark for the Rust engine. Public cross-tool comparisons should be run against the current Rust engine with exact versions, settings, workloads, and raw results published alongside the charts.
