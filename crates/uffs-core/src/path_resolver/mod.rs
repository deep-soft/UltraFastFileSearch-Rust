//! Path resolution from FRS numbers.
//!
//! Reconstructs full file paths from the parent-child FRS relationships.
//!
//! This module provides two implementations:
//! - [`PathResolver`]: HashMap-based, flexible but slower
//! - [`FastPathResolver`]: Vec-based O(1) lookup, optimized for MFT data
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! For typical MFT data with millions of entries:
//! - `FastPathResolver` is 3-5x faster than `PathResolver`
//! - Uses ~50% less memory due to `NameArena`
//! - `add_path_column_parallel` uses Rayon for multi-threaded resolution
