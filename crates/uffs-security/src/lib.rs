//! operations. It has **no dependency** on MFT, search, or UI crates.

//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`crypto`] — AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption (Phase S2)
//! - [`keystore`] — Platform-native key storage: DPAPI / Keychain / Secret
//!   Service (Phase S2)
//! - [`fs`] — Secure file operations: atomic write, secure delete, permissions,
//!   file locking

// Platform-gated deps: used by sub-modules behind #[cfg] gates.
// Suppress unused-crate-dependencies lint for platforms where the
// usage is behind cfg and the lint can't see it.
