## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`ext_rare` 543 ms outlier on drives with zero matching extensions**
  (Run 12, 2026-04-21 — `crates/uffs-core/src/search/query/numeric_top_n.rs`,
  `crates/uffs-core/src/search/filters/mod.rs`,
  `crates/uffs-core/src/search/filters/apply.rs`,
  `crates/uffs-core/src/search/sorting.rs`).  Two compounding bugs
  in the `*.<extension>` pipeline:
  - **Bug A (perf)** — `numeric_top_n::search_index` fell through to
    a full-drive scan when `resolve_ext_ids_for_drive` produced an
    empty ID set.  On a 3.5 M-record drive with zero `.dbt` files,
    `C:*.dbt --hide-system --hide-ads` cost 543 ms of pure scan
    plus a spurious row from Bug B.  **Fixed** by adding an explicit
    short-circuit arm that skips the drive entirely when the
    resolved-ID set is empty.
  - **Bug B (correctness)** — the `matches_record` /
    `row_passes_filters` fallback extracted extensions via
    `name.rsplit('.').next().unwrap_or("")`, which returns the
    whole name for dotless inputs.  A directory literally named
    `dbt` therefore matched `--ext dbt` even though the MFT
    indexer's `intern_extension` had already assigned it
    `extension_id = 0` (no extension bucket).  **Fixed** by adding
    a shared `extract_extension_after_dot` helper that matches
    `intern_extension` semantics exactly (dotless, dotfile, and
    trailing-dot names all return `""`), and replacing the buggy
    extraction in `matches_record`, `row_passes_filters`, and the
    `search::sorting` sort-key builder.  The sort-key fix closes
    a latent data-leak where dotless names leaked between
    extension groups on extension-sorted result sets.
  - **11 new regression tests** pin the fixes:
    `search::filters::tests::extract_extension_after_dot_*` (5 —
    helper semantics), `filter_extension_fallback_*` (4 —
    end-to-end `matches_record` fallback), and
    `search::backend::tests::search_index_ext_rare_*` (2 —
    end-to-end `*.dbt` on a drive with zero `.dbt` files).
- **`--profile` per-drive match counts rewritten O(rows×drives) →
  O(rows)** (`crates/uffs-daemon/src/index/search.rs:282-310`).
  The previous implementation nested `filter(|row| row.drive == D)
  .count()` inside a per-drive loop, producing quadratic work in
  the result cross product.  Single-pass `HashMap<char, usize>` tally
  then projects back over `drive_info` to preserve the existing
  (drive, count) ordering contract.  Cuts `--profile` overhead on
  wide result sets (e.g. 100 K rows × 4 drives) from ~400 K
  predicate evaluations to ~100 K hash inserts.

### Changed
- **`scripts/windows/cross-tool-benchmark.rs` no longer hard-codes
  `--profile`** in the default UFFS invocation (Run 12, 2026-04-21).
  The bench now measures the exact command shape a normal user
  types; `daemon_ms` is still captured on an opt-in basis via
  `UFFS_EXTRA_ARGS="--profile"` (environment variable).  Previous
  runs paid <0.2% overhead from `--profile`, so summary numbers
  remain comparable — change is primarily methodological
  cleanliness for public-facing benchmarks.

### Added
- **Phase 3 — `--columns parity` / `--parity-compat` and `--format custom`
  now take the daemon pre-format fast path**
  (`crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler.rs::RequestHandler::try_pack_csv_blob`).
  Both exclusions from Phase 2 are lifted; the daemon now produces the
  full 25-column legacy parity layout and the `Drives? … / MMMmmm …`
  drive footer server-side, leaving the CLI a pure `write_all` on
  the received blob.  Specifically:
  - `--columns parity` and `--parity-compat` both route through
    `uffs_format::write_rows` with `parity_compat=true` — the new
    behaviour that `build_output_config` auto-promotes `columns ==
    "parity"` into `parity_compat = true` keeps the CLI's
    `write_parity` (always rewrites dir rows) and the daemon's
    `write_rows` (rewrites only when flag is set) emitting
    byte-identical output even for `--columns parity` queries that
    omit `--parity-compat`.
  - `--format custom` accepts the CSV body through the shared
    writer, then appends the legacy footer via
    `uffs_format::write_legacy_drive_footer`.  The drive letters
    come from the new `SearchParams::output_drive_targets` wire
    field; empty targets skip the footer entirely, matching the
    CLI's baseline behaviour.
  - Parity always emits the 25-column header even when
    `output_header=false`: the daemon explicitly overrides
    `cfg.header=true` when `parity_compat` is active so the CLI's
    hand-rolled `write_parity` (which ignores the header flag) and
    the daemon fast path stay byte-identical on
    `--parity-compat --noheader` queries.
- **`uffs-format::footer` module — canonical legacy drive footer writer**
  (`crates/uffs-format/src/footer.rs`).  Carves the
  `write_legacy_drive_footer` + `DriveFooterContext` +
  `is_full_scan_pattern` helpers out of the CLI-private `parity.rs`
  into the shared crate so the CLI slow path
  (`write_native_results("custom", …)`) and the daemon fast path
  (`try_pack_csv_blob` with `output_format == "custom"`) share a
  single implementation.  Includes a self-test suite
  (`uffs_format::footer::tests::*`) that pins the CRLF shape, the
  `"MMMmmm that was FAST"` heuristic, the row-count threshold
  (`FAST_SCAN_ROW_LIMIT = 20 000`), the pipe-joined drive-letter
  formatting, and the full-scan pattern classifier.  Re-exported
  from `uffs-client::output` so the CLI preserves its thin-client
  invariant of depending only on `uffs-client`.
- **`SearchParams::output_drive_targets` wire field**
  (`crates/uffs-client/src/protocol/mod.rs`).  Carries the CLI's
  local `targets: Vec<char>` computation (from `--drive`,
  `--drives`, and the thin-client passthrough `--mft-file` path) to
  the daemon so `try_pack_csv_blob` can reproduce the footer
  exactly.  Intentionally separate from `SearchParams::drives`
  because "drives to search" and "drives to show in footer" are
  semantically distinct — e.g. `--mft-file D.mft` targets D for the
  footer but leaves `drives` empty.  Absent / empty → footer
  omitted (matches `uffs_format::write_legacy_drive_footer`'s
  empty-targets short-circuit).
- **CLI `write_columnar` now emits canonical byte-parity output**
  (`crates/uffs-cli/src/commands/output/mod.rs`).  The slow path
  that runs when the daemon returns `InlineRows` has been aligned
  with `uffs_format::write_rows` in three places so the CLI
  fallback and the daemon fast path cannot drift:
  - **Quote policy:** only string-shaped columns (`Path` / `Name` /
    `PathOnly` / `Type` / `Extension`) get quote-wrapped; numeric,
    datetime, and boolean-flag columns emit raw.  Matches the match
    arms in `uffs_format::writer::write_row` — the new helper
    `is_quoted_column` is the single authority both sites check.
  - **Timezone:** `extract_field` now takes a `tz_offset_secs`
    parameter fed from the parity context, and
    `format_filetime_with_tz` mirrors
    `uffs_format::append_datetime_native` exactly.  The older
    `format_filetime_local` is retained for the `--format table`
    human-display path (intentionally host-local for that surface).
  - **Header terminator:** the header row is now closed with
    `\n\n` (header + blank separator line) instead of a single
    `\n`, matching `uffs_format::write_rows` and the legacy
    baseline that `uffs-core::output::tests::format_parity_*`
    already pin.
- **Datetime zero-sentinel alignment across CLI and daemon**
  (`crates/uffs-cli/src/commands/output/{mod.rs,parity.rs}`).  Both
  `format_filetime_local` and `append_datetime_tz` now emit
  `"0000-00-00 00:00:00"` on an unset FILETIME (zero ticks, for
  which `uffs_time::filetime_to_calendar` returns `None`).  The
  previous empty-string behaviour diverged from
  `uffs_format::append_datetime_native` and silently produced
  different bytes between the CLI slow path and the daemon fast
  path on rows with zero Created/Modified/Accessed values — a
  latent Phase 2 inconsistency.
- **Six new byte-parity regression tests across CLI writers**
  (`crates/uffs-cli/src/commands/output/output_tests.rs`).  Pin
  every axis the Phase 3 lift depends on:
  - `parity_byte_parity_basic_file_zero_filetime` — datetime
    sentinel agreement.
  - `parity_byte_parity_directory_rewrite` — Path / Name /
    `PathOnly` / Size / `SizeOnDisk` parity-dir rewrite for
    directory rows.
  - `parity_byte_parity_all_flag_bits` — 15-column flag dispatch
    and `ParityAttributes` final column agree for every
    `PARITY_MASK` bit.
  - `parity_byte_parity_multi_row` — row ordering and header /
    blank-separator structure.
  - `columnar_byte_parity_zero_filetime_date_columns` +
    `columnar_byte_parity_nonzero_filetime` — pins the
    `write_columnar` ↔ `uffs_format::write_rows` alignment
    (quote policy, TZ, `\n\n` header) end-to-end.
- **Six new daemon regression tests for the Phase 3 gate lift**
  (`crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler.rs::tests`).  Replace the
  Phase 2 `skips_columns_parity` / `skips_parity_compat_flag`
  tests (which pinned the old exclusions) with positive-assertion
  coverage of the new behaviour:
  - `accepts_columns_parity` — `--columns parity` lands on
    `InlineBlob`, header matches the canonical 25-column legacy
    layout + `\n\n`, and the sample directory row gets the
    parity-dir rewrite (`\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\app\\\\\",\"\",`).
  - `accepts_parity_compat_flag` — `--parity-compat` on a
    non-parity projection still rewrites dir rows (Path gets
    trailing `\`, Size swapped to `treesize`).
  - `parity_forces_header_when_disabled` — parity overrides
    `output_header=false` so the fast/slow paths agree on
    `--parity-compat --noheader`.
  - `custom_appends_footer_when_drives_set` — `--format custom`
    with non-empty `output_drive_targets` produces a blob whose
    tail contains the CRLF `Drives? \t1\tC:\r\n` footer and the
    `MMMmmm that was FAST` warning for a full-scan pattern under
    the row threshold.
  - `custom_omits_footer_when_no_drives` — empty
    `output_drive_targets` skips the footer entirely (matches the
    CLI's baseline).
  - `skips_non_csv_format` (updated) — `"json"` / `"table"` /
    `"CSV "` (trailing-space garbage) still skip; the old
    `"custom"` entry is removed because it is now accepted.
- **Daemon-side multi-column CSV pre-format fast path**
  (`crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler.rs::RequestHandler::try_pack_csv_blob`).
  Extends the existing path-only blob fast path (`try_pack_paths_blob`)
  to every multi-column CSV projection the daemon's formatter can
  reproduce byte-for-byte.  When the gate accepts the request, the
  handler consumes the inline `Vec<SearchRow>`, feeds it through
  `uffs_format::write_rows` with the same `OutputConfig` the
  `--out=file` path uses (via the newly `pub(crate)`
  `uffs_daemon::index::search::build_output_config`), and replaces
  `SearchResponse::payload` with `SearchPayload::InlineBlob` for
  payloads ≤ 512 KB or `SearchPayload::ShmemBlob` above that
  threshold.  The CLI then writes the buffer verbatim with a single
  `write_all`, skipping per-row JSON deserialisation, the
  client-side `extract_field` dispatch, and the `write_columnar`
  per-column render loop on the medium-to-large result sets where
  that dispatch dominates end-to-end latency.
- **New `SearchParams::output_format` wire field**
  (`crates/uffs-client/src/protocol/mod.rs`).  Carries the CLI's
  `--format` value (`"csv"`, `"json"`, `"custom"`, `"table"`) to
  the daemon so `try_pack_csv_blob` can gate correctly — the
  pre-format path only runs when the CLI will actually consume CSV
  output, and defers to the local formatter for JSON / table /
  `custom` (which appends a legacy drive footer the daemon does not
  emit).  Filled from `CliArgs::format` in `from_cli_args` and
  handled everywhere else by serde defaults — the field is optional
  and absent means "CLI default (csv)".
- **Nine new regression tests for `try_pack_csv_blob`**
  (`crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler.rs::tests::try_pack_csv_blob_*`).
  Mirror the path-only test layout:
  - **`happy_path_multi_column`** — pins the default CSV projection
    case (`output_format: None`, multi-column projection) lands on
    `InlineBlob` with the expected header + separator + row
    structure.
  - **`accepts_explicit_csv_format`** — `output_format =
    Some("csv")` in every case combination (lowercase, uppercase,
    mixed) is accepted.
  - **`skips_json_response_mode`**, **`skips_non_csv_format`**,
    **`skips_aggregations`**, **`skips_when_output_file_set`**,
    **`skips_columns_parity`**, **`skips_parity_compat_flag`**,
    **`skips_empty_response`** — each gate bullet in the method
    docstring has a dedicated test that keeps the payload as
    `InlineRows` instead of pre-formatting.
  - **`offloads_large_blob_to_shmem`** — 5 000-row fixture with
    padded paths produces a >512 KB blob, verifies the handler
    lands on `ShmemBlob`, streams the file back via
    `stream_paths_blob_into`, and compares the streamed bytes
    against a fresh in-memory `uffs_format::write_rows` reference
    call.  The file is deleted after the stream, mirroring the
    `try_pack_paths_blob` shmem test's lifecycle check.
- **`uffs-format` crate — unified CSV/columnar output formatter**
  (`crates/uffs-format/`).  Carves the shared CSV writer that both the
  daemon's `--out=file` path (`DisplayRow`) and the thin CLI's stdout
  path (`SearchRow`) now delegate to, so the two sites are byte-identical
  by construction rather than by accident.  The crate is polars-free,
  tokio-free, and depends only on `uffs-time` + `uffs-mft` + `itoa` +
  `rayon` + `serde` + the narrow `chrono` `clock` feature, preserving
  the thin-client binary-size invariant.  The public surface is
  `FormatRow` (trait abstracting over `DisplayRow` / `SearchRow`),
  `OutputConfig` (builder), `OutputColumn` (narrow enum mirroring the
  subset of `FieldId` the formatter needs), and `write_rows` (the
  entry point).  `uffs-client::output::write_search_rows` is a thin
  re-export used by CLI consumers that already depend on `uffs-client`.
- **Byte-parity regression tests for the formatter unification**
  (`crates/uffs-core/src/output/tests.rs::format_parity_*`).  Four
  tests — basic file row, parity-compat directory row, `--columns all`
  baseline, and 20 000-row parallel branch — pin that
  `uffs_format::write_rows(&[DisplayRow], …)` emits byte-identical
  output to the legacy `OutputConfig::write_display_rows(&[DisplayRow], …)`.
  Any future drift in either implementation trips at least one test
  before it reaches end-to-end parity suites.
- **`FieldId` ↔ `OutputColumn` drift-guard tests**
  (`crates/uffs-core/src/search/field/field_tests.rs::field_id_matches_output_column_*`).
  Three tests pin that every `FieldId` variant has a matching
  `uffs_format::OutputColumn` variant with identical `canonical_name`
  and `display_name`.  The `field_id_to_format_column` bridge in
  `uffs_core::output::display_rows_format_bridge` is an exhaustive
  `const fn` match, so variant-set drift trips at compile time; these
  tests cover the remaining metadata-drift surface at run time.
- **Phase 3 output-path optimization** (`docs/research/perf-phase3-output-optimization.md`)
  - **3.1 NUL fast path** — CLI detects `> NUL` / `> /dev/null` via the new
    `uffs_client::stdout_kind` module (Unix `fstat` + `/dev/null` device-id
    match; Windows `GetFileType` + `GetConsoleMode`) and auto-injects
    `--no-output`.  The daemon gates `SearchRow` materialisation on
    `include_rows`, so `paths_blob` packing, shmem offload, and IPC row
    transfer all no-op on suppressed queries.  Expected saving: 20–30 ms
    on medium result sets piped to NUL.
  - **3.2 Single-buffer multi-column console render** — the console branch
    of `write_native_results` now renders CSV / JSON / table / parity output
    into a `Vec<u8>` and issues one `stdout.lock().write_all`, replacing the
    previous `BufWriter<StdoutLock>` + per-row `writeln!` pattern.  Guarded
    by a 50 MiB cap via the pure `choose_console_strategy(row_count, cap,
    est)` helper — falls back to streaming on pathological result sets.
  - **3.3 Windows `WriteConsoleW` direct path** — when stdout is a real
    console on Windows, `uffs_client::stdout_kind::write_stdout_buffer`
    transcodes the rendered buffer to UTF-16 once and issues chunked
    `WriteConsoleW` calls, bypassing the narrow-CRT codepage translation
    that otherwise mangles non-ASCII output on legacy conhost.
- **Async `UffsClient` wire-protocol test coverage**
  (`crates/uffs-client/src/connect_tests.rs`) — six behavioural regression
  pins mirroring the sync suite (`status`-method contract,
  `ConnectionFailed` remediation text, `cached_status` short-circuit in
  both directions).  Drives the client through in-memory tokio
  `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` doubles — no real socket, no daemon.

### Changed
- **Bulkiness sort-key eliminates per-candidate `DisplayRow` allocation**
  (`crates/uffs-core/src/search/query/numeric_top_n.rs`).  Added
  `bulkiness_for_record(&CompactRecord)` as a sibling of `bulkiness_for_row`;
  both forward to a shared private `bulkiness_from_sizes` so they cannot
  drift.  On the numeric top-N hot path this shaves an 18-line
  `DisplayRow::new(..., String::new(), ...)` dance — ~μs per candidate —
  measured impact ≈ 45 ms on a 45K-row `--sort bulkiness *.dll` query.

### Fixed
- **`shmem::tests` race** — `concurrent_writes_get_unique_paths` and
  `gc_cleans_orphaned_bins_and_preserves_non_bins` shared the global
  `shmem_dir()`; the GC test's `cleanup_stale_shmem_files()` sweep could
  wipe in-flight files written by the concurrent-writes test when cargo's
  threadpool scheduled both in parallel.  Serialised via a file-local
  `Mutex<()>`.  Production never hit this — GC only runs at daemon
  startup, and the PID file prevents overlap in real usage.
- **Two miswritten `#[expect(clippy::cognitive_complexity)]` reason strings**
  in `crates/uffs-daemon/src/index/mod.rs` had been copy-pasted from
  unrelated functions (`load_single_mft_file` tagged as "multi-drive
  search"; `ensure_drives_loaded` as "tree metrics computation").
  Replaced with accurate per-function justifications.

## [0.5.65] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Phase 2 performance measurement series** (closed): 11 instrumented
  runs comparing UFFS to Everything / UltraSearch / ES across cold-warm-hot
  phases.  Shipped `docs/research/perf-phase2-measurement-plan.md` as
  the permanent record.
- **`paths_blob` single-buffer fast path (v0.5.35)** — daemon packs
  path-only projections into a newline-terminated UTF-8 buffer; CLI
  writes with one `write_all`, skipping per-row JSON deserialisation.
  Inline for ≤ `SHMEM_THRESHOLD` rows; large results fall back to the
  shmem transport.
- **UAC refactor (v0.5.36)** — `ElevationPolicy::RequireExistingElevation`
  default, `--elevate` opt-in, `UFFS_ELEVATE=1` session override, plus an
  actionable error surface listing all three recovery paths (elevated
  shell, explicit UAC, broker install).
- **Deep health check (Run 10 Part B)** — `UffsClientSync` /
  `UffsClient` consolidate the connect-time liveness probe and
  pre-search readiness poll into a single `status` RPC, with a
  `cached_status` short-circuit in `await_ready`.  ~5–10 ms saved per
  CLI invocation on Windows named pipes.
- **Shared-memory transport for bulk results** (`uffs-client::shmem`) —
  results beyond `SHMEM_THRESHOLD` bypass JSON and memory-map a temp
  file.  Includes format v2 binary header, best-effort GC of stale
  `.bin` files on daemon startup.
- **Cross-tool benchmark harness**
  (`scripts/windows/cross-tool-benchmark.rs`) — drives UFFS, Everything,
  UltraSearch, and the legacy `uffs.com` C++ build through an
  apples-to-apples workload with cold/warm/hot phases and per-drive
  isolation.

### Changed
- **`cli_args.rs` refactored** — 11 stateless parsers extracted to
  `cli_args_helpers.rs`; `search.rs` tests moved to `search_tests.rs`
  via `#[path]` module re-attach.  Keeps both files under the 800-LOC
  file-size policy with no suppression.
- **Startup profiling** — `UFFS_PROFILE_STARTUP=1` prints per-phase
  wall-clock from `main()` through first `write_all`, driving the
  Phase 2 + Phase 3 measurement work.

### Fixed
- **`*.<ext>` and `<letter>:*` CLI sugar** — parse-time promotion to
  `pattern="*" + ext=<ext>` (and drive-prefix extraction) was briefly
  regressed during the fat→thin CLI split; restored plus a dispatch-time
  safety net in `uffs_core::search::backend::search_index` for direct
  JSON-RPC callers.
- **PathOnly sort** — now matches Windows Folder-column semantics
  (directories compare before files at equal path prefix; case-folded
  via the drive's upcase table).
- **Lifecycle / PID file** — stale-PID detection, `--no-retire` flag
  for long-running CI sessions, and session-tier upgrades (TUI / GUI /
  MCP at tier 1 get 3× the idle timeout of CLI at tier 0).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-15

Major architectural milestone — daemon-first CLI, MCP adapter, and
aggregate engine all ship together.

### Added
- **Aggregate engine** (`uffs_core::aggregate`) — Stages 0-5 complete:
  scaffolding + `AggregateMeta`; protocol + daemon + CLI integration;
  rollup, duplicates, parser, presets; pagination + CSV/TSV export;
  cache; `--agg` flag surface; MCP aggregation tools; 10-test
  validation suite (T119–T128).
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) gateway** (`uffs-mcp`) — stdio adapter
  that bridges Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI agents to the
  daemon via JSON-RPC.  D3.4.5 notifications, D4.3 E2E tests, MCP
  resources + prompts.
- **Security hardening** — S1 cache DACL / file permissions, S2.2.2
  Windows DPAPI keystore, S4 daemon IPC hardening (peer credentials,
  input validation, limit caps), S4.3 client-side daemon identity
  verification (macOS codesign / Windows Authenticode), S4.4 rate
  limiting + idle timeout + shutdown nonce, S5 Access Broker hardening.
- **`uffs-broker`** — optional Windows service providing elevated MFT
  handles so the daemon itself can run `asInvoker` with no UAC prompt.
- **Scenario M** — incremental MFT hot-load validation scenario; exercises
  the daemon's `load_drive` + `info` + `refresh` paths against live
  drives.

### Changed
- **`--parity-compat` mode** — `CPP_COLUMN_ORDER` for exact C++-binary
  output shape, `parity_attributes()` mask for the 15 baseline NTFS
  flag bits.  Lets the Rust daemon drop into legacy automation with
  zero ini changes.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-12

Daemon-first architecture lands — CLI / TUI / GUI / MCP are now all
thin clients over a unified `uffsd` process.

### Added
- **Daemon foundation (D2)** — `IndexManager` holds the compact index +
  trigrams; `IpcServer` over Unix domain socket (macOS/Linux) or named
  pipe (Windows); RPC handler; lifecycle manager with idle auto-retire.
- **Client library (D3)** — `UffsClient` (async, tokio) and
  `UffsClientSync` (blocking, tokio-free) with auto-start, keepalive,
  reconnect, structured error types.
- **MCP adapter scaffolding (D4)** — stdio bridge, initial tool
  definitions, handler dispatch.
- **Windows Access Broker scaffold (D7)** — `uffs-broker` service,
  client, shared handle passing via Win32 named pipes; unblocks the
  "no UAC prompt for search" target posture.
- **Thin-client CLI / TUI / GUI** — `uffs`, `uffs_tui`, `uffs_gui` now
  delegate all heavy lifting to the daemon.  TUI drops from ~7 GiB
  peak RSS to < 50 MB.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Compact index** — 72 bytes/record `CompactRecord` (`repr(C)`,
  `bytemuck::Pod/Zeroable`) replaces the full `MftIndex` after cache
  build.  ~72% memory reduction (7.5 GB → 2.1 GB for 25.9M records
  across 7 drives).
- **TUI** (`uffs_tui`) with ratatui — search box, paginated table,
  multi-tier sort (seven columns), file/dir/all filter, drive colour
  palette.  Wave 1 (trigram index, textarea, devicons) and Wave 2
  (table, sort, filter) complete.
- **Tree-based path search** — children index + segment decomposition
  for `C:\foo\bar`-style queries; glob matching with `*`, `?`, `**`.
- **On-demand full record lookup** — 25-column max view via seek+read
  from the `.uffs` cache, no need to keep full records in memory.
- **`.uffs` cache on macOS** — mirrors the Windows cache flow so MFT
  files captured on Windows can be searched on macOS.
- **Persistent search history** (`Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+N`) — platform
  config dir, deduplicated, survives restarts.
- **Keymap system** — `~/.config/uffs/keys.toml`, embedded
  `PRESET_WINDOWS` and `PRESET_EMACS`, `--keys emacs` CLI override.

### Fixed
- **NTFS flags refactor** — `StandardInfo.flags` now stores raw
  `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*` bits matching Windows semantics (`IS_READONLY=0x0001`,
  `IS_HIDDEN=0x0002`, etc.) instead of an internal remapping.  Cache
  format v9 (v8 auto-converts via `v8_flags_to_raw_ntfs()`).  Unblocks
  downstream parity work.
