# UFFS benchmark charts

Version-dated, shareable SVG charts generated from the canonical benchmark reports. Designed for:

- **Embedding in the hub + canonical report** (renders natively on GitHub, works in light + dark mode because of the explicit white-card design).
- **Screenshotting for social posts** (HN, Reddit, Twitter/X, LinkedIn). The white-card design is readable on any platform theme and crops cleanly at 2:1 or 16:9.
- **Click-through verification** — every chart cites the raw log file in [`../raw/`](../raw/) that produced its numbers, so readers can audit each bar.

## Design system

- **White card background** with a subtle `#e2e8f0` 1 px border — readable on any IDE theme, any platform. No `currentColor` / theme-inheritance games; the chart looks identical on dark HN, light Twitter, any IDE preview.
- **Dark-on-white typography** using a slate palette (`#0f172a` titles, `#475569` subtitles, `#334155` body labels, `#64748b` axes, `#94a3b8` footers).
- **Accent colors** are fixed per concept across every chart:
  - UFFS Rust v0.5.66: `#2563eb` (blue-600)
  - Everything: `#94a3b8` (slate-400)
  - UFFS C++ reference: `#ea580c` (orange-600)
  - Winning ratio callouts: `#059669` (emerald-600)
  - Architectural ceiling warnings: `#dc2626` / `#991b1b` (red-600/800)
- **Font:** system stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, ...`) — renders cleanly on macOS, Windows, Linux, and in browsers.
- **ViewBox-based responsive sizing** so GitHub / Markdown renderers can scale them to any container width without pixelating.

## When to update

When a new canonical benchmark report is cut (e.g. v0.5.70 supersedes v0.5.66):

1. Create a new dated directory: `charts/YYYY-MM-vX.Y.Z/`.
2. Re-produce the same five charts with the new numbers using the same design system.
3. Update the hub README and the new canonical report to embed the new chart paths.
4. Leave the old directory untouched — prior charts live forever, same archive discipline as [`../archive/`](../archive/) and [`../raw/`](../raw/).

## Regeneration

These SVGs are hand-written (explicit `<rect>` / `<text>` / `<line>` / `<circle>` elements with pre-computed pixel positions from the raw data). For a new canonical report, the fastest path is usually: copy the previous directory, then find-and-replace the data values + axis bounds. ~20 minutes per full set.

No external dependencies, no renderer to install, no chart-library version drift. The text of the SVG **is** the source of truth; there's no `.png` fallback to keep in sync.
